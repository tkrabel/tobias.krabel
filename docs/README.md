**This is the very beginning of my personal project**. Expect a lot of things to change over the course of time.

[Blog](/blog/) <br />A space for me to reflect and collect.

[Principles and Mental Models](/principles/) <br />Decision making frameworks and mental models. Principles are fundamental truths or propositions that serve as the foundation for a system of belief or behaviour. You can establish principles that weaken you, and you can establish principles that empower you. I chose to collect the latter. I am not happy with the naming yet, as I want to distinguish **fundamental concepts** from **tools**, and perhaps also keep them separate from **approaches**. Let's see how well this goes in the future =).

[Knowledge](/knowledge/) <br />This is my repository of personal knowledge that I update from time to time when I find interesting links or research a topic. This knowledge will spread from biology over psychology & philosophy to computer science & maths.

[Summaries](/summaries/) <br />Here I summarise useful pieces. However, my goal is to abstract out useful common wisdom from several summaries to create a good foundation of principles, so expect this section to be somewhat to be a knowledge cache.

## Projects

[pyforest](https://github.com/8080labs/pyforest) <br />
pyforest is an open-source Python package that handles package imports for you. With pyforest, you don't need to write import statements anymore.

[ppscore](https://github.com/8080labs/ppscore) <br />
The predictive power score (in short: PPS) is an asymmetric, data-type-agnostic score that can detect linear or non-linear relationships between two columns. The score ranges from 0 (no predictive power) to 1 (perfect predictive power). It can be used as an alternative to the correlation or other measures of bivariate relationship.
