# Knowledge

Richard Fienman famously kept a list of "Things I don't know". This is my own list and zettlekasten - a repository of personal knowledge that I update from time to time when I find interesting links or research a topic. These small changes are like compound interest. I only expect them to be useful and accurate after a lifetime of updates.

Use the sidebar to get started.

Publishing an accumulation of my personal knowledge online serves multiple purposes:

1. __Clarification__: There is a concept in software development called _refactoring_. Refactoring is the process of restructuring the internal software code to make it clearer - it doesn't usually affect the functionality but it helps to create clarity within the code. This blog is a refactoring of my knowledge. It forces me to reorganise my thoughts.
2. __Improvement__: Another popular software development concept is that of Kaizen. Kaizen is a Japanaese term which translates to "improvement". In the software world this it is a continuous process that is applied to every area, from the code to the development practices. This has a "compound" effect, where lots of small changes eventually create amazing results.
3. __Correction__: This is my personal implementation of _Cunningham's Law_, which states that "the best way to get the right answer on the internet is not to ask a question, it's to post the wrong answer." I make no promises that everything is correct or set in stone. If you can find logical fault in my thoughts, I encourage you to tell me. You can either submit a pull request on Github (if you know how), or you can message me directly.
