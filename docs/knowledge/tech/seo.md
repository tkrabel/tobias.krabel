# SEO Cheatsheet

> Warning: don't use this site as a shining example of SEO.


## Glossary

- Authority: how well a site ranks for certain keywords. Certain domain names automatically have high authority (for example, `.gov`)


## Technical SEO

Make sure the following headers are present on each page

```html
<title>Keep under 70 characters</title>
<meta name="description" content="~300 characters">

<!-- Open graph -->
<meta name="og:title" property="og:title" content="">
<meta name="og:type" property="og:type" content=""> <!-- https://ogp.me/#types -->
<meta name="og:description" property="og:description" content="">
<meta name="og:image" property="og:image" content="">

<meta name="robots" content="index, follow">
<link href="URL" rel="canonical">
```


## Do

- Get as many backlinks as possible from external sites. The higher their authority, the better the link.
- Add (lite) images/graphs with captions


## Don't

- Copy/paste content from other areas of the web, or your own website

## Interlinking

1. Find all keywords on your site by typing into google: `site:yoursite.com “[keyword]”`
2. Open each page that has the keyword
3. Link that keyword to the main article on your site for that keyword
