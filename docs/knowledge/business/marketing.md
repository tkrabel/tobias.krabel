# Marketing

## Mastering distribution

### Central formula

Distribution = Ecosystem participants + incentives

### Approach

- Create a directed graph of all ecosystem participants, an arrow showing who is influencing/affecting who
    - e.g. facebook (ads), medium, bloggers
- Think about how you can incentivize them (financially and non-financially)
    - non-financially, e.g. free product, coupon, priority support, a badge

## Building and efficient marketing funnel

### Central questions

- Who is your audience?
- What do you want them to do?

### Approach

- Define conversion funnel
- Define conversion targets, e.g. 2000 ppl on website -> 1000 trials -> 500 buys
- Map each conversion target to a positive statement
    - Visits -> targets: your product is **interesting**
    - Trials -> buys: your product is **useful**
- Measure conversions
- If you don't meet a conversion target, improve

### Mindset

- Marketing is a marathon
- You only win by doing, collecting data, and reflecting
