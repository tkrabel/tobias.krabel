## Between the lines

Brian spent two weeks talking "countless hours" to customers (they had 2,000 WAUs at that time!) to define the market hypothesis more concretely

We need to plan **at least 4 weeks** until we have somewhat compelling market hypothesis

**After** they had the market hypothesis, they defined the four key areas of the product hypothesis

Then built an MVP and checked if they had PMF!

They hadn't a Channel hypothesis at that time (and the **Model hypothesis was a best guess**), but focused on PMF

After 12 months, they revisited their audience to see whether there is a larger market

After 18 months, 100x larger MRR (from 1k to 100k)

## Learning from between the lines

You need distance from your product. Think of it as some stranger has built it, think strategically!

1. spend ≥ 1 month working on the market hypothesis. Talk to as many "customers" as possible!
2. After having formed a Market hypothesis, define the Product hypothesis
3. Build a rough MVP
4. Make your Model hypothesis (i.e. price and packaging) based on a best guess. Ask for any price > 0 (1$ if it needs to be)
5. Check retention on the MVP → PMF?
6. Then form **Channel hypotheses (plural!)**. Think about aligning Product <> Channel. The product has to fit the channel, the channel won't mold to the product
7. Choose the channel that fits the model hypothesis (Think about CAC ↔ ARPU spectrum). Choose **one channel for each tier in your model** (e.g. virality for free tier, paid or content marketing for $10/user tier)
8. Spend ≥ 2 months testing out your hypotheses. If it doesn't work out → back to the drawing board!
9. Revisit your target audience after 3 months. Can you capture an even larger market?
10. If you see larger willingness to pay, introduce another pricing tier. If you do that, check the model <> market and model <> channel fit!

## Four channel framework

Market

Channel

## Market hypothesis

- **Category**. What category of products does the customer put you in?
- **Who**. Who is the target audience within the category? There are always multiple personas within a single category, so this breaks it down further.
- **Problems**. What problems does your target audience have related to the category?
- **Motivations**. What are the motivations behind those problems? Why are those problems important to your target audience?

## Product hypothesis

- **Core Value Prop**. What was the core value prop of the product? How did it tie to the core problem?
- **Hook**. How could the core value prop be expressed in the simplest terms?
- **Time To Value**. How quickly could we get the target audience to experience value.
- **Stickiness**. How and why will customers stick around? What are the natural retention mechanisms of the product?

## Model

**What value does product X generate?**

## Channel

*Every price tier receives an own channel*

**What channels are ppl consuming?**

## Pricing

How to find price

- **Cost plus**: Know your CAC!
- **Value-based**: Value hard to communicate. Be conservative and ask for a tiny fraction of the value you create (start with 10% of the value)
- **Competitor based**.
- **Customer survey pricing:**
    - Think about the last six months. How much percent of your time or are you spending doing X?
    - Then communicate value
    - Then negotiate the price

## Product Market fit

[https://brianbalfour.com/essays/market-product-fit](https://brianbalfour.com/essays/market-product-fit)

Three criteria

1. Qualitative: Net promoter score (NPS) or "very disappointed" score > 40%
2. Quantitative: Flattening retention curve (but keep in mind you may have natural churn build in into your product)
3. Intuitive: When the market is dragging you forward.
