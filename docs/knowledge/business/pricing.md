## Pricing Cheatsheet

How to find price

- **Cost plus**: Know your CAC!
- **Value-based**: Value hard to communicate. Be conservative and ask for a tiny fraction of the value you create (start with 10% of the value)
- **Competitor based**.
- **Customer survey pricing:**
    - Think about the last six months. How much percent of your time or are you spending doing X?
    - Then communicate value
    - Then negotiate the price
