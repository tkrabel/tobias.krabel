Principles, approaches and habits for businesses and startups

**Contents**

[[toc]]

## Healthy habits

Here is a list of healthy habits that ultimately apply to all domains in life, but become particularly important when running a startup. I hope this list will help others too.

### Prioritizing time

Spent time with prioratization.

- **Benefit**: It helps reduce stress by staying focused on what's important.
- **Approach**: Do a lightweight prioritazion session at the beginning of each day, week, and month. Consistency is key. When prioritizing, remember that the point of all work is ultimately to **help other people** (i.e. customers or team members in most cases). Framing your goals from this perspective helps you reconnect with a sense of purpose.

### Reduce fear by connecting

**Approach**: Install proactive and obligatory feedback loops and dedicate time to connecting and sharing.

### Get feelings off your chest

**Approach**: Write a journal or talk with a friend of colleague.
**Benefit**: There is [scientific evidence](https://www.bakadesuyo.com/2015/09/make-you-happy-2/) that describing an emotion in just a word or two helps reducing the emotion.


## Seed Phase Principles

There is one guiding principle for operating at Early stage: find profitable product-market-fit, while keeping your costs as small as possible.

### The game

- Product market fit

### The approaches

- Adaptability
- Ignore the minutae - everything is 80/20

### How to spend money

Spend as if you will never be able to raise again.


### Mental models

**Be patient for growth, but impatient for profitability**

When the winning strategy is not yet clear in, entreprenuers should be patient for growth, but impatient for profitability. Entreprenuers should not spend a lot of money in the pursuit of the wrong strategy. Once a business figures out a unit-profitable strategy, entreprenuers should be patient for profitability and impatient for growth.

Many startups try to start directly at growth stage and skip finding product market fit. This is often not their fault. VC's typically demand it of them. VC has a short fund life and therefore needs their portfolio companies to give them an exit event before the fund closes. Forget the VC.

**Your first idea *will* be wrong**

93% of all companies that ultimately become successful have to abandon their original strategy. Successful companies don't succeed because they have the right strategy and the begining but because they have money left over after the original strategy fails, so that they can try another strategy.

This is critical. Don't assume your idea *might* fail. *Expect* it to fail.

**MVP vs MLP**

- Low competition markets: Solving a problem/need. Minimum Viable Product.
- High competition markets: Building a better product. Minimum Loveable Product.

## Growth Phase Principles

As soon as a company has found product market fit, it can move into a growth stage.

### The game

The game is now: how to grow without breaking.

- How to scale while keeping your product solid
- Focus on sales
- Economies of scale: gaining more customers, retain existing good customers, trade up bad customers
- Economies of scope: upselling & increasing offerings without increasing costs

### The process

- Building systems
- Be detail oriented - everything 20/80

### How to spend money

Focus on sales. Spend enough to remove competition.

### Mental models

**Be impatient for growth, but patient for profitability**

Good money vs Bad money: When the winning startegy is not yet clear in the initial stages of a new business, good money from investors needs to be patient for growth, but impatient for profitability. It demands that a new company figures out a viable strategy as fast as possible and entreprenuers don't spend a lot of money in the pursuit of the wrong strategy. Once a profitable and viable way forward has been discovered, entreprenuers should be patient for profitability and impatient for growth.
