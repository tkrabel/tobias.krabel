Decision making framework for life events

**Contents**

## Seek Early Truth

Sounds like an obvious one, but it's clearly not. In everything you do, you should always seek the truth quickly.

## Healthy habits

Here is a list of healthy habits that ultimately apply to all domains in life, but become particularly important when running a startup. I hope this list will help others too.

### Morning Ritual

A morning ritual helps us stay motivated achieving our goals and make good decisions for the day.

#### Transcendental meditation

Do it every morning, for as long as you want (I prefer 10 - 20 minutes). It consists of four steps

1. Find a comfortable place
2. Take a relaxed position (but sit upright; don't leaagainst something; this prevents you from falling asleep)
3. Close your eyes and focus on your breathe
4. During the meditation, repeat a sound that has no association with anything for you (like "EM", "OM", "SHI", "CHI", etc.; otherwise, you will start mind-wandering from the sound. If you're interested, try to use a word like "ship" and observe your thoughts go bananas). A "meaningless" sound will shut your thoughts.

#### Morning Pages

Sit down, take pen and paper or your laptop and write down *whatever* comes into your mind (Persist your stream of thought). I usually stop when I reach 1 - 3 pages.

**Benefit**: This exercise is truly powerful! When putting your unfiltered thoughts on paper, you get a clearer picture of what's important for you in life. Also, you reflect and reduce your sorrows (simply by expressing them).

#### Questions for the morning

**Approach**: Take 5 minuntes to reflect on these questions in the morning. Pick as many questions as you want.

- How can I make today great? How can I do good today?
- What am I *thankful* for?
- What *matters* most today?
- Meta question: Which morning habits set me up for success?

**Benefit**: The investment of time in reflecting on these questions reminds you of your goals. Reviewing our priorities and schedule will return exponential dividends throughout the day. You will be calmer, more focused, and better able to balance the urgent needs of the day and your longer-term commitments and goals.

#### Prioritizing time

Spent time with prioratization.

- **Benefit**: It helps reduce stress by staying focused on what's important.
- **Approach**: Do a lightweight prioritazion session at the beginning of each day, week, and month. Consistency is key. When prioritizing, remember that the point of all work is ultimately to **help other people** (e.g. friends, family, customers or team members). Framing your goals from this perspective helps you reconnect with a sense of purpose.
- **Important**: keep a time slot for yourself.

### Reduce fear by connecting

**Approach**: Install proactive and obligatory feedback loops and dedicate time to connecting and sharing.

### Get feelings off your chest

**Approach**: Write a journal or talk with a friend of colleague.
**Benefit**: There is [scientific evidence](https://www.bakadesuyo.com/2015/09/make-you-happy-2/) that describing an emotion in just a word or two helps reducing the emotion.

### Contemplating Death

Being aware of your death puts all the urgencies in the material world you might feel in a more healthy perpective. It helps you focus on what really matters to you and it's a good antidote to (unhealthy) perfectionism and workaholism. A mantra that helped me most: "At the end of my life, when I am lying in bed, ready to die, I won't think about that awesome pitch deck or app I've created. I will think about all the meaningful relationships I have had, all the love I have received and all the love I was able to give."

## Asking Good Questions

Good questions are open, curious, simple, reflective, and start with "how" and "what".
seven powerful questions that every leader can use with their team:

* **The Kick Start Question**: What's on your mind?
* **The A.W.E. Question**: And what else?
* **The Focus Question**: What's the real challenge here for you?
* **The Foundation Question**: What do you want?
* **The Lazy Question**: How can I help? or What do you want from me?
* **The Strategic Question**: If you say yes to this, what must you say no to?
* **The Learning Question**: What was most useful or most valuable here for you?

## Other helpful principles

Thoughts that need to be fleshed out in order to deserve a larger heading.

### Walk 20 miles every day

And use Pareto along the way

### Minimise regret

Make decisions based on the least possible regret.

### Always try your best

So that you can always look back and be satisfied that the outcome could not have been better.

### Always be honest

To yourself, so that you can always make decisions based on the facts. To others, so that they will know you are consistent.

### Always be wholesome

So that you can look at your difficult relationships and tell yourself that it's difficult because of their own reasons, not something you have done.

### Fascination / Curiosity

Gives you enjoyment of the tasks that your are performing. Don't seek the enjoyment outright, focus on the task.

### Learn to like

Things that are accessible and within reach.

### Learn to avoid

Things that are inaccessible and give only fleeting happiness.

### Learn to be grateful

For the things you already have. Life is precious and we are incredibly lucky in the west.

### When you want to be resilient

Work on your weaknesses

### Never underestimate your impact

The [six degrees of separation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_degrees_of_separation) say that all people on this planet are at most six social connections away from each other. We are nodes in a huge network. The impact you have on one person (even if it's tiny) likely propagates through that network and therefore magnifies in a way you cannot predict. Therefore, **never underestimate the goodness you can spread in this world**.
