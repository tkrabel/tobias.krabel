Decision making framework for life events

**Contents**

[[toc]]


### Walk 20 miles every day

And use Pareto along the way

### Minimise regret

Make decisions based on the least possible regret.

### Always try your best

So that you can always look back and be satisfied that the outcome could not have been better.

### Always be honest

To yourself, so that you can always make decisions based on the facts. To others, so that they will know you are consistent.

### Always be wholesome

So that you can look at your difficult relationships and tell yourself that it's difficult because of their own reasons, not something you have done.

### Fascination / Curiosity

Gives you enjoyment of the tasks that your are performing. Don't seek the enjoyment outright, focus on the task.

### Learn to like

Things that are accessible and within reach.

### Learn to avoid

Things that are inaccessible and give only fleeting happiness.

### Learn to be grateful

For the things you already have. Life is precious and we are incredibly lucky in the west.

### When you want to be resilient

Work on your weaknesses

### Never underestimate your impact

The [six degrees of separation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_degrees_of_separation) say that all people on this planet are at most six social connections away from each other. We are nodes in a huge network. The impact you have on one person (even if it's tiny) likely propagates through that network and therefore magnifies in a way you cannot predict. Therefore, **never underestimate the goodness you can spread in this world**.
