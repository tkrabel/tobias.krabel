Decision making framework for life events

**Contents**

[[toc]]


## Healthy habits

Here is a list of healthy habits that ultimately apply to all domains in life, but become particularly important when running a startup. I hope this list will help others too.

### Prioritizing time

Spent time with prioratization.

- **Benefit**: It helps reduce stress by staying focused on what's important.
- **Approach**: Do a lightweight prioritazion session at the beginning of each day, week, and month. Consistency is key. When prioritizing, remember that the point of all work is ultimately to **help other people** (i.e. customers or team members in most cases). Framing your goals from this perspective helps you reconnect with a sense of purpose.

### Reduce fear by connecting

**Approach**: Install proactive and obligatory feedback loops and dedicate time to connecting and sharing.

### Get feelings off your chest

**Approach**: Write a journal or talk with a friend of colleague.
**Benefit**: There is [scientific evidence](https://www.bakadesuyo.com/2015/09/make-you-happy-2/) that describing an emotion in just a word or two helps reducing the emotion.

## Asking Good Questions

Good questions are open, curious, simple, reflective, and start with "how" and "what".
seven powerful questions that every leader can use with their team:

* **The Kick Start Question**: What's on your mind?
* **The A.W.E. Question**: And what else?
* **The Focus Question**: What's the real challenge here for you?
* **The Foundation Question**: What do you want?
* **The Lazy Question**: How can I help? or What do you want from me?
* **The Strategic Question**: If you say yes to this, what must you say no to?
* **The Learning Question**: What was most useful or most valuable here for you?

## Other helpful principles

Thougths that need to be fleshed out in order to deserve a larger heading.

### Walk 20 miles every day

And use Pareto along the way

### Minimise regret

Make decisions based on the least possible regret.

### Always try your best

So that you can always look back and be satisfied that the outcome could not have been better.

### Always be honest

To yourself, so that you can always make decisions based on the facts. To others, so that they will know you are consistent.

### Always be wholesome

So that you can look at your difficult relationships and tell yourself that it's difficult because of their own reasons, not something you have done.

### Fascination / Curiosity

Gives you enjoyment of the tasks that your are performing. Don't seek the enjoyment outright, focus on the task.

### Learn to like

Things that are accessible and within reach.

### Learn to avoid

Things that are inaccessible and give only fleeting happiness.

### Learn to be grateful

For the things you already have. Life is precious and we are incredibly lucky in the west.

### When you want to be resilient

Work on your weaknesses

### Never underestimate your impact

The [six degrees of separation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_degrees_of_separation) say that all people on this planet are at most six social connections away from each other. We are nodes in a huge network. The impact you have on one person (even if it's tiny) likely propagates through that network and therefore magnifies in a way you cannot predict. Therefore, **never underestimate the goodness you can spread in this world**.
