# Impact List

I think it's important to know what impact you have in the world. This has two positive effects:

1. **Motivation**: let's face it. Some days, we ask ourselves whether what we do has any postive impact. Having a list of impacts keeps us moving forward.
2. **Reflection and Correction**: This list serves as a mirrow. Do I like what I see there? Is it consistent with who I want to be? If I a) see too many things on that list that I don't consider valuable contributions or b) can't find items to put on that list, I have to ask myself if what I am doing is right for me.


## Impact on people

- Mentoring people in Data Science with the goal of making them feel comfortable with the domain and be maximum effective. Quickly & thoroughly understanding and leveraging data is critical. Data Science is a fast field and consequently confusing for beginners. Mentoring offers a huge ROI. Plus, it's fun because I love teaching and supporting.
